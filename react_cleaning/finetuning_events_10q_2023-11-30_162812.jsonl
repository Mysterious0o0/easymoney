I'll try to infer the rationale based on my knowledge of music theory.\n\nAnswer: In music theory, the note \"do\" is the first note of the diatonic scale and it is equivalent to the note \"C\" in the chromatic scale. In the key of D, the note \"do\" would be \"D\". However, in some contexts, it might be necessary to refer to this note as \"#C\" (C sharp) or \"bD\" (D flat) instead of \"D\". This could be due to the key signature, the harmonic context, or other musical considerations. For example, in a piece of music in the key of D major, the note \"C\" is not naturally occurring, so it would be referred to as \"#C\" (C sharp). Similarly, in a piece of music in the key of D flat major, the note \"D\" is not naturally occurring, so it would be referred to as \"bD\" (D flat). This alternative naming helps to maintain the integrity of the musical scale and provides clarity in musical notation."}]}

This is called \"re-entrant tuning\". The high G string provides a unique voicing, as it allows for different chord inversions and melodic possibilities that wouldn't be possible on a linearly-tuned (low to high) instrument. It gives the ukulele its distinctive sound."}]}
